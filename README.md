# Covid-19-portfolio-project
The project is all about utilizing SQL to retrieve value data from real-world datasets of the COVID-19 pandemic from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.
The Queries would then be visualized in Tableau.
Covid-19 was a worldwide pandemic that caused much damage to the world. 
Over 50 million people were estimated to be infected, while more than 5 million deaths occurred due to covid-19.
My interest in this project is sponsored partly by my medical affiliation. 
I used SQL to query results from the recent Covid-19 pandemic. 
Using SQl, I retrieved the following records: Highest death, Highest infection rate by percentage, Highest mortality rate, global COVID-19 numbers, Vaccination rate, and many more.
